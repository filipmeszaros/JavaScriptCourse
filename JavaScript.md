## Javascript
Javascript is dynamically typed (no need to specify variable types), interpreted language (interpreter reads and executes the program, no compiler is needed).

#### Node.js
NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
Download link: https://nodejs.org/en/download  
Check version installed: `node --version`  
**npm - node package manager** - used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine  
**npx - node package executer** - used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.

Each JavaScript file should have suffix `.js`  
You can execute JavaScript files with command: `node path/filename.js`
