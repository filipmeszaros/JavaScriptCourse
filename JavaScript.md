## Javascript
Javascript is dynamically typed (no need to specify variable types), interpreted language (interpreter reads and executes the program, no compiler is needed).

#### Node.js
NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform Javascript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
